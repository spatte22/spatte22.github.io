<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You have two options for uploading files: <a href="#task1">directly to the Activity Feed</a> or as <a href="#task2">part of an existing task</a>. You may want to share important files for collaborators, information to clients, and so forth. Other users can conveniently access files from multiple locations around the project.</p>
<p><b>General Facts About Uploading Files:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Mavenlink supports almost all file types.</li>
		<li>File size limitations: 2GB for a Teams plan, 5GB for a Premier plan.</li>
		<li>You can upload Google Drive files (Google Sheets, Google Docs, and so forth) if your user or business account is integrated with <a href="https://mavenlink.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202811750-Google-Apps-Integration-Overview-">G Suite</a>.</li>
		<li>All project collaborators can view basic details for a file upload from the Files tab of the project or the Files page (<span class="interface">Dashboard</span> > <span class="interface">Files</span>). Basic details include: <span class="fieldName">Date Added</span>, <span class="fieldName">Size</span>, <span class="fieldName">Uploaded By</span>, and <span class="fieldName">Linked Task</span>.</li>
		<li>All project collaborators can download files from anywhere the file is accessible - the Activity Feed, the task Files tab, the project Files tab, or the Files page (<span class="interface">Dashboard</span> > <span class="interface">Files</span>). Note that the visibility of a post can be limited, thereby limiting access to the file.</li>
		<li>You can access all files uploaded to any project that you're assigned in your Dashboard menu. Hover over <span class="interface">Dashboard</span> in the navigation menu and select <span class="interface">Files</span>. </li>
	</ul>
