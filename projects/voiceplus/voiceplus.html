				<h1>Voice Plus</h1>
<p>
  Voice Plus is the traditional channel for phone calls, plus all the other features
  that Eltropy provides. Not only can agents handle a phone call, they can also
  do things like send text messages, perform a Remote Check Deposit, or co-browse
  with a contact while on the call. The ability to use Eltropy features while on
  a call expands your ability to assist contacts and meet their needs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Voice Plus offers all the standard phone call features, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Call controls like mute and hold</li>
  <li>Conference calls</li>
  <li>Voicemail</li>
</ul>
<p>It also offers contact center features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Warm and cold transfers</li>
  <li>Callbacks</li>
  <li>Supervisor barge-in</li>
  <li>Call recording and transcripts</li>
  <li>After-call work (applying tags and notes)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Additionally, you have options for reporting. The Live! dashboard lets users
  view real-time data, and your Reports and Insights modules let you obtain historical
  data.&nbsp;
</p>
<h2 id="">Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Voice Plus</h2>
<p>You have two options for utilizing AI with voice calls:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Analyze your voice interactions to generate useful insights</strong><br>
    Along with interactions through other channels,
    <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Intelligence</a>
    can analyze your voice calls and produce data about the interaction.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Handle voice calls with a voice AI agent</strong><br>
    <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voice AI agents</a>
    can handle the bulk of contacts' simpler issues. This opens up bandwidth
    for human agents to handle more complex issues. If the AI agent is unable
    to satisfactorily resolve an issue, the contact can transfer to a human agent.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="">Voice Call Flows</h2>
<p>
  Voice calls route through your system using a call flow. A call flow is like
  a phone menu system or IVR. The call flow works with your skill based routing
  setup to connect incoming callers with the best agent to handle their request.
  It also lets you add customizations to the phone menu, like offering callbacks
  for long queue times. You create a call flow in the
  <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call Flow Designer</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<div class="notification-tip">
  <strong><p>Tip</strong>:</p>
  <p>Consider what happens when a contact starts a chat through the Conversations
  Panel. They open the panel, possibly verify their phone number, then select a
  queue. At this point, your skill based routing (SBR) takes the request and routes
  it to the most-appropriate agent. The system takes care of the routing according
  to your SBR setup.</p>
  <p>
    For voice calls, a call flow gives you granular control over this routing
    experience. You can play messages to the caller, offer a menu system, and
    so forth.
  </p>
</div>
<h2 id="">Contacts Using Private Numbers</h2>
<p>
  Mobile devices often have a setting for the owner to hide their personal information
  from caller ID. This makes the number Private or Unknown. Eltropy accepts calls
  from these numbers, and will handle them as anonymous contacts. This means that:
</p>
<ul class="ak-ul">
  <li>Agents start the interaction with a limited feature set</li>
  <li>
    Agents need to
    <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">verify the contact</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    The contact won’t be saved in your system unless the agent verifies their
    number
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="">International Phone Calls</h2>
<p>
  Eltropy generally supports calls to countries outside the USA. Refer to the
  <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Phone Numbers</a>
  page for more information.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="ExternalPhoneNumbers"></a>
</p>
<h2 id="">External Phone Numbers</h2>
<p>
  There are scenarios where you may repeatedly receive calls from an external phone
  system <u>into</u> your Voice Plus setup, or repeatedly
  transfer calls to an external system
  <u>from</u> your Voice Plus setup. For example, a
  credit card company may frequently send callers over to you to handle issues.
  Similarly, you may be doing the same; sending callers over to a credit card company.
  You want to be sure that your Eltropy system handles these scenarios separate
  from standard calls from contacts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Repeated inbound calls or transfers</strong><br>
    By default, Eltropy treats these like any other inbound call. This is problematic
    because even though the actual caller is different each time, Eltropy is
    receiving the transfer from the
    <u>same phone number</u>. For example, a
    credit card company's Billing department may repeatedly send callers to you.
    Your Eltropy system uses phone numbers as the primary identifier for contacts,
    so the system thinks that it's repeatedly receiving calls from the same contact,
    just because they're coming from the same Billing department. This causes
    two problems:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The actual caller that is being transferred does not have its own
        contact entry in your Eltropy system.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        This skews your reporting data since individual phone numbers - ie:
        the Billing department - seem to be making a large number of calls.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    To correct this issue, you can
    <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enter these external phone numbers into your Voice Plus settings</a>.
    Whenever the system receives a call from these external phone numbers, they're
    treated as anonymous calls. This allows the agent to verify the phone number
    and enter the contact's details, creating a new contact in your system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Outbound calls or transfers</strong><br>
    In scenarios where your agents are sending callers to a specific phone number
    outside your Voice Plus system, the external system always receives calls from
    your Voice Plus phone number handling the call. Also, when transferring calls
    externally, agents can dial a specific number, or they can select an external
    number. External numbers display as options if you
    <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add them in your Voice Plus settings</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
            </div>

            <div id="setup" class="tab-pane">
<h1>Set Up Voice Plus</h1>
<h2 id="">Pre-Requisites</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Configure the necessary network settings explained on the
    <a href="#">networking and firewall</a>&nbsp;page.
    This includes whitelisting the necessary IPs and FQDNs to allow voice traffic.
  </li>
  <li>
    Procure at least one phone number from the Twilio voice provider. Create
    a ticket with Eltropy Support or contact your Eltropy representative to assist
    you with this.
  </li>
</ol>
<div class="notification-note">
  <p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
  <P>Before configuring the Twilio number in Eltropy, ensure that necessary features
  like Audio Management and Workflow Manager are enabled in the Admin Portal with
  the help of your Eltropy representative.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="">Step 1: Configure Your Skill Based Routing</h2>
<p>
  A call flow lets you customize what happens when a caller initially calls you,
  like offering a menu system. In addition to this menu system, the Eltropy system
  must route the caller to the most-appropriate agent to handle their request.
  Your skill based routing components allow your system to do so. This includes
  components like departments, queues, routing profiles, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  If you have an existing SBR setup, you may need to review this setup and incorporate
  the voice channel.
</p>
<p>
  Review the<a href="#"> Contact Routing page</a>
  to learn about the different SBR-related components. Your SBR setup is unique
  for your business structure and use-cases, therefore setting up or editing SBR
  will be different for every domain.
</p>
<p>At a minimum, be sure you have the following set up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Departments</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Queues</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Hours of operation</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Routing profiles + proficiencies</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Conversation permissions</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="">
  Step 2: Add Countries for International Phone Calls (Optional)
</h2>
<p>
  If you want to be able to call – or receive calls – from phone numbers outside
  the USA, you must<a href="#"> add your desired countries in your domain settings</a>.
</p>
<div class="notification-note">
  <p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
  <p>Even though Puerto Rico uses the +1 country code, you cannot communicate to phone
  numbers from Puerto Rico by default. An Eltropy representative must enable Puerto
  Rico for your domain.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="">Step 3: Create a Voice Plus Call Flow</h2>
<p>
  A call flow lets you control how a call routes through your system, like a phone
  menu system or IVR. You create a flow in the Call Flow Designer.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Pre-requisite</strong>: Before you create a call flow, review the<a href="#"> Call flow designer page</a>.
  Review the call blocks and what they’re able to do. You may also want to plan
  your call flow or create a sample diagram.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="#">Follow the instructions here to create a new call flow</a>.
  You may want to work with your Eltropy representative for guidance. Also, you
  may want to create the flow in a UAT environment. This will allow you to test
  the flow and your voice settings before going live.
</p>
<p>Be sure to test the call flow.</p>
<div class="notification-example">
  <p><strong>For example</strong>:</p>
  <p>A contact calls your support line and selects an option from your IVR menu for
  loan services. This flow could look like this:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>IVR Prompt plays</strong>: "Press 1 for Loan Services, Press
      2 for Card Services."
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Member Presses 1</strong>: The call is routed to the Loan Services
      queue.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Queue Checks</strong> for the following.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Business Hours</strong>: Check if the Loan Services
              queue is within business hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Online Agents</strong>: Check if there are online
              agents available.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Queue Length</strong>: Check if the queue length
              is less than 3.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Routing</strong>: If all checks pass, route the call to an agent<strong>.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      If the queue is overloaded, offer the contact options to request a callback
      or leave a voicemail. For this scenario, the AI Agent is not configured
      in the call flow.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
<h2 id="">Step 4: Configure Your General Voice Settings</h2>
<p>
  Once you have the phone number configured and the call flows are created, mapping
  the call flow is necessary for managing the inbound and outbound calls. Once
  done, you need to configure phone number for inbound calling in the voice settings.
</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to configure voice settings.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Navigate to <span class="interface">Conversation settings</span>
    <img class="inline-icon" src="/guide-media/01JPBC9MJP6PN7MFJCF23GRYM5" alt="ConversationsettingsButton.png">.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click <span class="interface">Voice settings</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the <span class="interface">General Setting</span> tab.
  </li>
  <li>
    (Optional) If you want to record all voice calls, enable
    <span class="fieldName">Voice recording.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    (Optional) If you want to skip the pop up that prompts agents to configure
    their audio, enable
    <span class="fieldName">Skip incoming call preview</span>. The preview screen
    lets an agent ensure their audio are configured. Once the agent has configured
    their audio devices,
    <u>they typically won't need to do it for every call</u>.
  </li>
  <li>
    (Optional) If you want to allow agents to make an outbound call to 911:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Enable <span class="fieldName">Emergency Calling</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        For <span class="fieldName">Emergency call notification to users</span>,
        add a phone number that will receive a text message from Eltropy
        when an agent makes a 911 call. This informs the owner of this phone
        number that the 911 call was made.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enter the text message you want to send in
        <span class="fieldName">Emergency call text template</span>.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Click <span class="interface">Save</span>.<br>

  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="">Step 5: Add Phone Numbers</h2>
<p>
  You must enter the phone number(s) that you procured from Twilio. This allows
  your domain to make calls and receive calls using your Twilio numbers.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Navigate to <span class="interface">Conversation settings</span>
    <img class="inline-icon" src="/guide-media/01JPBC9MJP6PN7MFJCF23GRYM5" alt="ConversationsettingsButton.png">.

    Click
    <img src="/guide-media/01JQDER1GE1TDX8RQC3M8CCVB7" alt="NewPhoneNumberButton.png" class="inlie-icon">.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a name for the number, like Collections, Lending, or Contact Center.
  </li>
  <li>Enter the Twilio phone number.</li>
  <li>
    Select your desired inbound and outbound call flows. You can optionally choose
    <span class="fieldValue">Dynamic Routing</span>, which does not use a call
    flow. Instead, the system routes the phone call like interaction requests
    from other channels; it uses your skill based routing setup to route the
    call to the most appropriate agent.
  </li>
  <li>
    (Optional) Enter an address for your Emergency calling settings. If the agent
    makes an emergency call, this address is associated with the number, and
    is therefore accessible to the 911 call handler.<br>

<h1>Call Flow Designer</h1>
<p>
  The call flow designer lets you build an interactive menu system for voice calls.
  This allows you to customize the contact’s experience for both inbound and outbound
  voice calls. If call flows are enabled for your domain, you can access the call
  flow designer from the main navigation bar under <strong>Flows</strong>.
</p>
<p>Key capabilities of call flows are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Providing navigation options so the contact can choose who they want to speak
    with
  </li>
  <li>Offering AI voice bots and other self-service options</li>
  <li>
    Allowing multiple calls to occur through a phone number at the same time
  </li>
  <li>
    Generally ensuring that the agent most fit for the issue assists their callers

</ul>
<div class="expandable">
  <div class="expandable-header">View a list of typical features of a phone menu system</div>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A DTMF menu system that lets callers choose which department they

        <em>“Press 1 for Sales, press 2 for Technical Support, press 3 for Billing; for all other issues, press 4”.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Self-service options that let callers perform basic tasks like resetting
        an account password, accessing an account balance, or paying a bill.
        The market is already beginning to adopt AI bots to help contacts
        accomplish these tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        “Quality of life” features that make the phone call experience more
        convenient for callers. This may include on-hold music, holding the
        caller’s place in the call queue while waiting for an agent, leaving
        voicemails, offering surveys, and so forth.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ability to pull-in information about the caller from a CRM (or
        similar) system. This lets the system authenticate callers, display
        information to agents, and so forth.

<p>
  Building a call flow is like creating a diagram (the diagram being the call flow).
  The designer lets you build out each step of the menu system just like a diagram.
  You drag and drop blocks onto the canvas which you connect one after another.
  Each block performs a task or action like playing on-hold music, transferring
  the call, making an API call, and so forth. When the contact calls one of your
  phone numbers, they start the call flow. Then, the contact moves through the
  flow block-by-block. When they “arrive” at a block, the block fires and performs
  its task or functionality.
</p>
<p>Here is a basic example of a call flow:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2 id="">Key Facts About Call Flows and the Call Flow Designer</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Call flows are called “projects”.</li>
  <li>
    You can create both inbound and outbound call flows. A phone number can be
    assigned one inbound flow and one outbound flow.
  </li>
  <li>
    After creating a call flow, you assign it to a phone number in
    <span class="interface">Conversation settings <img class="inline-icon" src="/guide-media/01JPBC9MJP6PN7MFJCF23GRYM5" alt="ConversationsettingsButton.png"></span>
    &gt; <span class="interface">Voice settings</span> &gt;
    <span class="interface">Phone Numbers</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can create call flows for both English and Spanish languages.
  </li>
  <li>
    Single connectors between blocks are called paths. A group of blocks and
    paths connected together is called a pathway.
  </li>
  <li>
    Call flows are not yet fully integrated with AI capabilities. If you have
    AI set up for your domain, you can use the IVA Transfer block to send the
    contact from the call flow IVR to interact with an IVA.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="">Call Flow Interface</h2>
<p>
  The following is the interface of a call flow. The numbers in the screenshot
  indicate key components of the interface. The table under the screenshot explains
  these key components.

      Sends a text message to the contact from a department you specify in
      this block’s properties. This block has two properties, one to select
      a specific department and the other to enter the message you want to
      send to the contact.
    </p>
    <p>Examples of usage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Send a text to a contact after their call finishes with a survey
        link
      </li>
      <li>
        Prompt a follow-up interaction after a call with a message like
        <span class="fieldValue">How was your experience today?</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<!-- closes expandable -->
<div class="expandable">
  <div class="expandable-header">Media</div>
  <div class="expandable-content">
    <p>
      Lets you play an audio file to the contact. You can upload an MP3 or
      WAV file from your computer or link to a file stored on the internet.
      The maximum file size that you can upload is 20MB.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to consider the following when uploading a media file, especially
      when the file is used for on-hold music:
    </p>
    <p>
      Audio played over the telephone network is transcoded to a format the
      telephone network understands. Regardless of the quality of the file,
      the system transcodes the file so it plays correctly. This may result
      in lower quality because the telephone network does not support high
      bitrate audio. High bitrate, lossy encoded files, such as 128kbps mp3
      files, take longer to transcode and potentially sound worse than files
      that are in lossless 8kbps formats. This is due to the inevitable degradation
      that occurs when converting from lossy compressed formats and the processing
      involved in converting from higher bit rates to low bit rates. Playing
      a file that is longer than 40 minutes can result in a dropped call. If
      you need to play a file longer than 40 minutes, consider splitting it
      up into smaller chunks.

<h3 id="">Input Blocks</h3>
<div class="expandable">
  <div class="expandable-header">Options</div>
  <div class="expandable-content">
    <p>
      <span class="interface">Options</span> lets you present a set of menu
      options to the caller. They can make a selection with their keypad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to other similar options like
      <span class="interface">Queues</span>, this block lets you create menus
      that are more flexible; you can enter the prompt that plays for each
      option, the button the option is associated with, and so forth. You are
      not obligated to provide options for 1, 2, 3 buttons in order; you can
      add options for 1, 2, and 9, for example. You can also add options for
      the * and # keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example usage of this would be a language menu that says
      <em>“For English, press one; para español, marca dos”</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Keep the following in mind when using these options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the DTMF option is configured but not connected to any subsequent
        block, the menu will be repeated if that DTMF value is selected (applies
        to * and #)
      </li>
      <li>
        If the No Reply and No Match paths are not connected to subsequent
        blocks, the menu will be repeated.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you add options for the contact to choose a queue (or department),
        be sure to connect that option with a
        <span class="interface">Select Queue</span> block then a
        <span class="interface">Transfer to queue</span> block. This is because
        the options menu only presents a list of options; the other two blocks
        handle the actually routing of the call.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="notification-tip">
      <P><strong>Tip</strong>:</p>
      <P>Be careful with using * and # options. To make sure the text-to-speech
      says exactly what you want to say, you may want to spell out the word
      instead of using the actual character. For example, "<em>Press star to repeat the menu options</em>".</p>&nbsp;

<div class="expandable">
  <div class="expandable-header">Options Group</div>
  <div class="expandable-content">
    <p>
      Lets you dynamically create a menu of options from a variable value.
      This block is typically used with the <span class="interface">API</span>
      block. You can make an API call that returns a type of list or set of
      fields. When that response is captured in a variable, you can reference
      it in this <span class="interface">Options Group</span> block, which
      presents the options to the contact.
    </p>
    <p>To create a menu with this block:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make an API call to retrieve a set of options. This must occur in
        the flow before you want to present the menu.
      </li>
      <li>Capture the response as a variable.</li>
      <li>
        Add an <span class="interface">Options Group</span> block in the
        flow when you want to present the menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <span class="interface">Options Group</span> properties, select
        the variable with which you captured the API response in the
        <span class="fieldName">Create callflow options from variable</span>
        drop-down.
      </li>
      <li>
        For <span class="fieldName">Label key</span>, enter the JSON key
        from which you want to generate the menu options. This key should
        be the name of the object in the returned block of JSON.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="notification-example">
      <strong>For example</strong>:<br>
      You make an API call that returns a list of external phone numbers. From
      this list of numbers, you present each phone number as an option in a
      menu. When the contact makes a selection, you use the selected number
      in an <span class="interface">External transfer</span> block. The system
      makes an outbound call to the number and transfers the contact out of
      the system to the external number.
    </div>

<div class="expandable">
  <div class="expandable-header">Queues</div>
  <div class="expandable-content">
    <p>
      <span class="interface">Queues</span> lets you present a menu of your
      external queues to the caller. You select which queues you want to populate
      the menu with, and the block automatically plays the prompt
      <em>“Press one for &lt;queue 1&gt;, press two for &lt;queue 2&gt;…”</em>.
      The queues you add as menu options are played in consecutive order, starting
      with one. This is different from <span class="interface">Options</span>,
      which lets you add options for whichever key you’d like.
    </p>
    <p>
      This block is similar to <span class="interface">Options</span>, however
      it’s built to specifically provide a menu of queues.
    </p>
    <p>Keep in mind the following when using this block:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Be sure to connect each queue option with a path to a
        <span class="interface">Transfer to queue</span> block. This
        <span class="interface">Queues</span> block handles the queue selection
        and text-to-speech, however you still need to use a
        <span class="interface">Transfer to queue</span> block for the system
        to move the call into the selected queue.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        If you enable
        <span class="fieldName">Dynamically show available queues</span>
        in this block's properties, the caller will only be offered queues
        that have agents online who can handle this queue. This way, they
        don't select a queue with no agents online, leading to a dead end.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Error Paths</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>No Reply</strong>: This path is taken if the menu prompt
        plays and the contact does not enter a value during a specified amount
        of time. Enter the amount of time you want the menu to wait before
        taking this path. Best practice is to wait 5-10 seconds. You can
        also choose which path should be taken if the amount of time specified
        here passes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Match</strong>: This path is taken when the contact presses
        a key that does not match an option that you’ve configured. For example,
        if you add three queues, acceptable key presses are 1, 2, or 3. If
        the contact presses 9, which does not match 1, 2, or 3, this error
        path is taken.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- closes expandable-->
<div class="expandable">
  <div class="expandable-header">Voicemail</div>
  <div class="expandable-content">
    <p>
      Sends the contact to an
      <a href="#">offline queue</a> that you
      created, letting them leave a voicemail message. The voicemail appears
      in the inbox of each agent who is assigned the offline queue in their
      routing profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the contact moves through the call flow paths, when it arrives at
      this block and this block fires, it first plays an audible <em>beep</em>
      to the contact, then begins recording the contact-side microphone for
      the amount of time specified in the
      <span class="interface">Duration (seconds)</span> property. Before this
      block, you may want to add a <span class="interface">Speak</span> block
      that informs the contact to leave a message after the beep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to selecting a specific offline queue, you can configure
      two additional properties:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Timeout (seconds)</strong>: The amount of silence that the
        system waits for before automatically ending the voicemail message
        and the call.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Duration (seconds)</strong>: The amount of time that contacts
        have to record a voicemail.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Additionally, you can continue the call after this block. For example,
      you may want to use a Speak block that provides one last statement after
      the contact leaves a voicemail. If you continue the call flow after this
      block, the call moves to the next block after the amount of time you
      enter as the duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, a voicemail is not offered for a missed callback request. When
      the system offers an agent a callback request, if no agents accept it,
      it goes missed. A voicemail is not offered because callback requests
      initiate an outbound call to the contact (ie: calling them back); since
      the contact is not yet engaged on the call, they cannot leave a voicemail.
    </p>
  </div>

<h3 id="">Advanced Blocks</h3>
<div class="expandable">
  <div class="expandable-header">Condition</div>
  <div class="expandable-content">
    <p>
      Lets you create conditional logic, like an <em>if…else</em> statement.
      Depending on a certain condition that you set, a certain pathway can
      be taken as a result. You can add conditions for variables, variable
      values, logic groups, or expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A logic group lets you create nested conditions using both
      <strong>AND</strong> and <strong>OR</strong> blocks together. Without
      a logic group you could have only one level of conditions (A and B and
      C and D). With logic groups, you can use something like (A or B) and
      (C or D).
    </p>
    <p>
      An expression lets you directly write the conditions (like a code block)
      using the logical operators, variables, and brackets.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <div class="notification-example">
      <strong>For example</strong>:<br>
      In an <span class="interface">Options</span> block, the result path of
      <strong>No Reply</strong> leads to a <span class="interface">Set</span>
      block. Here, you set a variable that increments +1 each time the block
      fires. This <span class="interface">Set</span> block leads to a
      <span class="interface">Condition</span> block. The condition is that
      if the variable is less than or equal to 3, the contact is directed back
      to the <span class="interface">Options</span> menu. If the variable value
      is greater than 3, the path is taken to play a message that says
      <em>“We weren’t able to hear your response. Please text us at 8018675309”</em>.
    </div>
    <p>
      The idea is that the caller has three tries to make a selection in the
      menu. If the system does not detect a selection three times, it plays
      the message that prompts the caller to text the business instead.
    </p>

  <div class="expandable-content">
    <p>
      Lets you set a variable value. You can create a new variable and set
      its value, or change an existing variable’s value. If you create a new
      variable with this block, the new variable is automatically added to
      the Variables list on the left-side of the canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scope of all variables listed in the left-hand Variables section
      is global <em>within a flow</em>. You can use and reference any variable
      within a flow; you cannot reference variables from other flows. The exception
      to this global scope are any variables that you set in a Javascript block.
      Variables set in a Javascript block are limited to that specific block.

      If any call block does not have a path to another block – if a block
      is the last in a pathway – the call will automatically end after it finishes
      firing or functioning. This means that you do not need to explicitly
      end every pathway that you create. However, best practice is to end a
      pathway with this <span class="interface">End</span> block, making it
      clear that this is your desired and designed behavior.

      Keeps the contact waiting in a queue. This block is specifically designed
      to work with an advanced queue options flow. This flow lets you present
      options to a contact while they're waiting in a queue. For example, they
      can request a callback, switch to texting, or continue waiting. To continue
      waiting, the option should connect with this block. When doing so, this
      loops the queue waiting experience again:
      <span class="interface">Transfer to queue</span> block → wait template
      text-to-speech → wait music → options while waiting.&nbsp;

      <li>
        When this block fires and loops the contact back through the queue
        waiting experience, the contact does not lose their position in the
        queue. This ensures that they're able to select a different option
        while waiting in a queue, like requesting a callback, without losing
        their spot in line.

      Lets you make a REST API call. You must enter the full URI, select the
      verb, then add any headers, parameters, and how you want to capture the
      response. The API you’re calling must respond with a JSON block. From
      this block, you must capture the value of a specific JSON key in a variable.
      In the <span class="fieldName">Capture Response</span> field, use dot
      notation to specify which field in the response you want to capture.
      Use the following format:

  <div class="expandable-content">
    <p>
      <span class="interface">Select Queue</span> lets you create a path that
      leads to a specific queue. For example, you could add one of these blocks
      for each queue in an menu created with an
      <span class="interface">Options</span> block. If a contact wants to speak
      to a sales rep in the Sales queue, you can select the queue, check that
      sales agents are online, then transfer the contact to the queue with
      a <span class="interface">Transfer to queue</span> block. In this block’s
      properties, use the drop-down to choose which queue you want to work
      with in the path you’re creating.
    </p>
    <p>Keep in mind the following when using this block:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When you add blocks after this
        <span class="interface">Select Queue</span> block, the subsequent
        blocks "know" the queue that this block selected. For example, let's
        say you added this series of blocks:
        <span class="interface">Select Queue</span> →
        <span class="interface">Check queue reps online</span> →
        <span class="interface">Transfer to queue</span>. In this example,
        the Pony Loans queue was selected. The subsequent two blocks that
        check for reps then transfer the call keep the context that the Pony
        Loans queue was selected.
      </li>
      <li>
        You do not need to use this block after a
        <span class="interface">Queues</span> block. This is because the

    </div>
    <p>Settings to configure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Wait Template</strong>: Similar to the
        <span class="interface">Speak</span> block, you can use an AI voice
        to speak a message to the contact. Enter the text here that you want
        to play to the contact as text-to-speech. For example, you could
        enter: "<span class="fieldValue"><em>Please wait while we find the right agent to assist you</em>"</span>.
        After this message plays, this block then starts playing the
        <span class="fieldName">Wait Music</span>. After the music finishes,
        this wait message plays once again. As the contact waits for an agent,
        the block loops through playing the wait message and wait music.&nbsp;<br>
        In this setting, you can use specific tags. These tags dynamically
        insert information into the spoken text. For example, {{.firstName}}
        would play the contact's first name. You could enter:
        <span class="fieldValue">Thank you for waiting, {{.firstName}}, we'll be with you shortly</span>.
        Be sure to include the double curly braces and the period (dot notation).
        The following are tags that you can use for a wait message:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>firstName</strong>: The contact's first name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>lastName</strong>: The contact's last name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>email</strong>: The contact's email address.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>countryCode</strong>: The country code of the contact's
            phone number.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>mobile</strong>: The contact's phone number.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>domainName</strong>: The name of your Eltropy domain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>queuePosition</strong>: The contact's current position
            in the queue.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wait Music</strong>: Plays music to the contact as they’re
        in a queue waiting for an agent to answer. You can upload an MP3
        or WAV file from your computer, or link to a file stored on the internet.
        After the file finishes playing, the
        <span class="fieldName">Wait Template</span> you configured plays
        to the contact, then loops back to the wait music. Alternatively,
        if you connected this block to a subsequent block, the next block
        will fire instead of looping back and forth between the wait template
        and music.<br>
        If you do not upload or link any music, Eltropy plays a default wait
        music file. This default wait music is 25 seconds long.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hold Message</strong>: When an agent is actively speaking
        with the contact then places them on hold, an AI voice speaks this
        message. After the message finishes, the hold music begins playing.
        This block loops between the hold message and hold music while the
        contact is on hold.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hold Music</strong>: When an agent is actively speaking with
        the contact then places them on hold, this music plays after the
        Hold Message finishes. You can upload a music file from your computer
        or link to a file stored on the internet.<br>
        If you do not upload or link any music, Eltropy plays a default wait
        music file.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advanced Queue Options</strong>: Lets you offer a set of
        options while the contact is waiting in a queue. This is useful for
        long wait times; you can let the contact choose a callback, send
        a text message, leave a voicemail, and so forth. By default, the
        Wait Template configured in this block plays first, then the wait
        music. The system-default wait music plays for four minutes (or the
        wait music you uploaded), then the advanced queue options plays.
        If the contact continues waiting, this process repeats (Wait Template
        &gt; Wait Music &gt; Options). If you use the default wait music
        plays for 1.5 minutes with each subsequent loop before offering the
        options.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
      This block is typically used in combination with
      <span class="interface">Check queue depth</span>. You can check the queue
      depth, and if there are a certain number of contacts already waiting

      also applies to callback requests for voice calls. Callback requests
      allow a contact who is waiting in a queue to stop the call, but the system
      keeps their position in the queue. When it's their turn, the system offers
      the callback to an agent. When an agent accepts, the system makes an
      outbound call to the contact.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      This block also allows you to upload a file that plays wait or hold music.
      The maximum file size that you can upload is 20MB. Be sure to consider
      the following when uploading a media file, especially when the file is
      used for on-hold music:
    </p>
    <p>
      Audio played over the telephone network is transcoded to a format the
      telephone network understands. Regardless of the quality of the file,
      the system transcodes the file so it plays correctly. This may result
      in lower quality because the telephone network does not support high
      bitrate audio. High bitrate, lossy encoded files, such as 128kbps mp3
      files, take longer to transcode and potentially sound worse than files
      that are in lossless 8kbps formats. This is due to the inevitable degradation
      that occurs when converting from lossy compressed formats and the processing
      involved in converting from higher bit rates to low bit rates. Playing
      a file that is longer than 40 minutes can result in a dropped call. If
      you need to play a file longer than 40 minutes, consider splitting it
      up into smaller chunks.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- closes expandable -->
<h2 id="">Nodes and Blocks</h2>
<p>
  A call block contains nodes. For example, the screenshot below shows an
  <span class="interface">Options</span> block. Each option in the block is an
  individual node. The first three DTMF nodes were added in the block’s settings,
  and the <strong>No Reply</strong> and <strong>No Match</strong> nodes are default
  nodes that are configured in the properties.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/guide-media/01JPBBZGDMK3WM8K1ZAFAAKBAH" alt="Redacted image for privacy">
</p>
<p>
  When a block fires, the nodes run sequentially, one after another. In a simple
  block like <span class="interface">Options</span>, this plays the prompts one
  after another (requesting the caller to select 1, 2, and 3).
</p>
<p>
  You can combine nodes from multiple blocks into one block. In the below example,
  a single call block contains nodes from both the
  <span class="interface">Javascript</span> and
  <span class="interface">API</span> blocks. Because the nodes run sequentially,
  the API call would be made first, then the custom JavaScript would execute afterward.
  Click and drag a node to move it from one block to another, or to re-order the
  nodes within a single block.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/guide-media/01JPBC0B0NWH9R2K6G3V4KVWGK" alt="Redacted image for privacy">
</p>
<h2 id="h_01JSCP8WT34N3K8RP1EZFME4AZ">Text-to-Speech Effects</h2>
<p>
  Some blocks let you use text-to-speech. This means that you type a phrase in
  the block properties, and the Eltropy system speaks that sentence when the call
  block fires. A simple example of this is when you create a menu system with the
  Options block, and the system speaks "<em>Press 1 to speak with a teller. Press 2 to speak with a loan officer...</em>".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/guide-media/01JSCKR99ZAWVN1E1C7PA2HN4X" alt="Redacted image for privacy" width="250" height="249">
</p>
<p>
  You can select which effects to add to your text from the Effects drop-down.
  This adds XML to the text, denoting which words have the effect. You can edit
  the text + XML to control exactly how you want the effects to apply to the text.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Remember the following when adding TTS effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Be sure to include the text that you want to receive the effect
    <strong>in between</strong> the opening and closing tags. As shown in the
    screenshot below, the opening tag indicates that the text will be spoken
    slowly, and the closing tag is at the end of the sentence, ensuring that
    the full sentence will be spoken slowly. In other words, the tags are around
    the full text, so the full text receives the effect.
  </li>
  <li>
    As shown in the screenshot below, the text that will be spoken slowly is
    black. If the color of the text is light blue, like the color of the tags,
    then the text you type <strong>will not save</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<h2 id="">Call Flow Templates</h2>
<p>
  Eltropy does not yet support call flow templates. However, templates are on the
  roadmap as a future enhancement. If you have ideas for call flow templates, feel
  free to share them with your Eltropy support rep, as this may be useful for future
  enhancements or documentation.
</p>
<h2 id="">Call Block Paths</h2>
<p>
  The connectors between blocks are called paths. When a contact calls your system
  and enters the call flow, they’re able to navigate around the network of call
  blocks that are connected by paths. The only way a contact can move to different
  blocks is through a path.
</p>
<p>
  When you create a path between blocks, the system automatically creates the shape
  of the path. If you have a large, complex call flow, this may require you to
  spread out your blocks to for an easy-to-read structure. You may want to label
  your paths to simplify your designing experience.
</p>
<p>With paths, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li id="">
    <strong>Connect Call Blocks</strong><br>
    Each option in a block has a dot on the right side. Left-click the dot and
    drag your mouse to whichever new block or option you want to connect it with.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Delete Block Paths</strong><br>
    You can delete a path by clicking the path and pressing the delete key on
    your keyboard.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Label Block Paths<br></strong>You can add a label to call paths.
    This adds text to the mid-point of a path, giving you insight into where.
    the path leads and what it’s for. Just like call block labels, path labels
    are purely informational for call flow designers, they do not impact the
    contact experience or call flow.<br>
    To add a label, left-click a path to select it then click
    <span class="fieldName">Enter label</span> to begin typing.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="">Call Flow Versioning and Publishing</h2>
<p>
  As you edit a flow, your changes are automatically saved in the call flow designer.
  This means you do not need to save your changes as you work. It also means that
  your changes are only saved in the designer; a call flow is not updated with
  changes until you publish it. Publishing a call flow creates a new version of
  the flow with all changes that have been made. You can see and interact with
  these versions by clicking the <span class="interface">Version</span> button
  in the designer.
</p>
<p>
  Changes are only saved in the designer because the flow might already be in-use.
  When you assign a flow to a phone number, any time a call happens for that number,
  the call flow is in-use for that call. The flow designer lets you make and test
  changes that only exist in the designer. Once you click
  <span class="interface">Publish</span> in the designer, the system creates a
  new version of the flow and the phone number automatically uses the newest version.
  In this case, if a call flow is actively running for another contact, that call
  flow will not change. Only new contacts will use the newly-published call flow.
</p>
<h2 id="">Call Flow Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    You should always check for active agents before transferring to a queue.
    The only exception is when you use the
    <span class="fieldName">Dynamically show available queues</span> setting
    in the <span class="interface">Queue</span> block. Other checks are optional
    and depend on the use case, such as if you want a different message or handling
    for out of office hours.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="interface">Select Queue</span> is only needed when using the
    <span class="interface">Options</span> block. When using the
    <span class="interface">Queues</span> block, it will automatically handle
    this.

    Create a set of guidelines for your call flows, like a style guide. The guidelines
    help you structure all your call flows similarly, keeping them organized
    and uniform even if multiple personnel have access to them. Examples of call
    flow guidelines:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Label each call block according to its function, like
        <span class="fieldValue">Request callback</span> or
        <span class="fieldValue">Present menu of queues</span>.
      </li>
      <li>Label each pathway.</li>
      <li>
        Color code sets of pathways, like all blocks along the path for each
        queue in a menu option.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use canvas comments
        <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #292a2e;">only</span></strong>
        for questions or suggestions about the call flow.

<h2 id="">Create a Call Flow</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Required role</strong>: Domain Manager
</p>
<p>
  Before creating a call flow, work with your internal teams to understand the
  experience you want to create for your callers.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open your UAT domain.</li>
  <li>
    Click the <span class="interface">Flows</span> module in the left-hand main
    navigation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click <span class="interface">Create</span>.
  </li>
  <li>Name the call flow.</li>
  <li>
    For <span class="fieldName">Modality</span>, select if you want to create
    an inbound or outbound flow.
  </li>
  <li>
    For <span class="fieldName">Languages</span>, select which language you want
    the flow to support. This impacts the voice options and prompts the call
    flow plays to callers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select a <span class="fieldName">Default Voice</span>. This is the voice
    that speaks audio prompts to the callers. Individual call blocks can override
    this voice and use a different voice. You can hear what the voices sound
    like in the AI Config section of the Voice settings (Conversations module
    &gt; <span class="interface">Conversation settings</span>
    <img class="inline-icon" src="/guide-media/01JPBC9MJP6PN7MFJCF23GRYM5" alt="ConversationsettingsButton.png">
    &gt; <span class="interface">Voice settings</span> &gt;
    <span class="interface">AI Config</span>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Click <span class="interface">Save</span>. The new flow is added to the list
    of call flow projects.
  </li>
  <li>Click the newly-created call flow project.</li>
  <li>
    Design the call flow. Use the information on this page to help you create
    the flow.
  </li>
  <li>Test the flow to ensure that it functions as-designed.</li>
  <li>
    When the flow is tested sufficiently and ready to be used, click
    <span class="interface">Publish</span>. This creates a new version of the
    flow. If this is the first time the flow has been published, it is now available
    to assign to a phone number.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assign the flow to a phone number, explained in the next section.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="">Assign a Call Flow to a Phone Number</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Required role</strong>: Domain manager
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Pre-requisite</strong>: You must already have phone numbers added in
  the Voice settings.
</p>
<p>
  You assign call flows to phone numbers that are added in the Voice settings of
  the Conversation settings.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    In your domain, navigate to the Phone numbers tab of their Voice settings
    (<span class="interface">Conversation settings</span>
    <img class="inline-icon" src="/guide-media/01JPBC9MJP6PN7MFJCF23GRYM5" alt="ConversationsettingsButton.png">

    <span class="interface">Phone Numbers</span>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Locate the phone number for which you want to assign a call flow.
  </li>
  <li>Click the three-dots menu.</li>
  <li>
    Click <span class="interface">Edit</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select your desired call flow for
    <span class="fieldName">Inbound Call flow</span> or
    <span class="fieldName">Outbound Call flow</span>.<br>

  </li>
  <li>
    Click <span class="interface">Save</span>.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="">Start or Test a Call Flow</h2>
<p>
  An inbound call flow starts when a contact calls a phone number added in your
  voice settings. When this occurs, the inbound call flow selected in the phone
  number’s settings begins.
</p>
<p>
  An outbound call flow starts when an agent creates an outbound call using a phone
  number added in your voice settings. When this occurs the outbound call flow
  selected in the phone number’s settings begins.
</p>
<p>
  When you are editing a call flow, you can start the flow by clicking the
  <strong>Start</strong> button on the canvas or the <strong>Test</strong> button
  at the top. You must connect your first call block to this start button with
  a path. The contact begins its journey at the start button, through the path
  to your first block, then onto other blocks in the network you’ve created.
</p>
<h2 id="">Edit a Block’s Label</h2>
<p>
  Each block has a label at the top, like a heading or a title. By default, when
  you add a new block, its label is <span class="fieldValue">New Block</span>.
  You can change this label by clicking on
  <span class="fieldValue">New Block</span> and typing a new label. This helps
  you keep your call flow organized and understandable. Customizing a block’s label
  does not impact its functionality or how it runs, rather, it helps you manage
  your call flows and stay organized.
</p>
<p>
  You can enter whatever label you’d like. Best practice is to either add the name
  of the block, like <span class="fieldValue">Queues</span> or
  <span class="fieldValue">Check queue business hours</span>, or explain what the
  block is accomplishing, like
  <span class="fieldValue">Transfer to FTC for fraud report</span>.
</p>
<div class="notification-tip">
  <p><strong>Tip</strong>:</p>
  <p>If your organization has multiple staff who might edit call flows, you may want
  to draft a list of best practices for your call flows. For example, you may want
  to specify that each block’s label should be the name of the block, like Select
  Queue. This helps others understand each other’s call flows and easily manage
  all your flows.</p>
</div>
<p>You can also label paths that connect blocks.</p>
<h2 id="">Export a Call Flow</h2>
<p>
  You can export (or download) a call flow as a JSON file. This gives you flexibility
  to quickly transfer flows from one environment to another. You can export a call
  flow in two locations:
</p>
<p>
  While editing a call flow, click the download button beside the flow’s name:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/guide-media/01JPBCBSGFX3H50NQWJ5FQ70GC" alt="Redacted image for privacy">

</p>
<h2 id="">Import a Call Flow</h2>
<p>
  You can import call flow JSON files. This may be a simple option to bring a call
  flow from one environment to another.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Click <span class="interface">Flows</span> in the main Eltropy navigation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click <span class="interface">Import</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    For <span class="fieldName">Name</span>, give the call flow a descriptive
    name.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the <span class="fieldName">Project File</span> area to search for
    and select the file. You can also drag and drop the file into this area.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click <span class="interface">Import</span>.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="">Restore a Call Flow</h2>
<p>
  When you click the <span class="interface">Versions</span> button in the call
  flow designer, a list of versions displays. Beside each version is a
  <span class="interface">Restore</span> Flow button. This opens the call flow
  version that you restored from the list. This does not impact any flow that is
  actively used in production by a phone number. It only changes what you are actively
  editing.
</p>
<h2 id="">Revert a Production Call Flow</h2>
<p>
  When you click the <span class="interface">Versions</span> button in the call
  flow designer, a list of versions displays. Beside each version is a
  <span class="interface">Revert Production</span> button. The version with
  <span class="interface">(deployed)</span> beside its name is the call flow that
  your phone number is actively using and contacts are interacting with. You can
  choose any published call flow version to use in production.
</p>
<p>
  Click <span class="interface">Revert Production</span> and confirm your decision
  to use a specific flow in your live calls.
</p>
<div class="notification-note">
  <p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
  <p>Anytime you publish a new version of a call flow, that newly-published version
  is automatically used in production; calls to the associated phone number automatically
  use the version you just published. If you’re uncertain which version is deployed
  to production, click the <span class="interface">Versions</span> button and locate the version with <span class="interface">(deployed)</span> beside its name.</p>

			<h1>Call Flow Customizations</h1>
<p>
  Every financial institution has its own unique needs. Depending on your organization
  size and structure, the services you offer, and other factors, you may need to
  tailor your call flows to meet your needs. This page provides example customizations
  that may help you design your call flows.
</p>
<p>
  Feel free to use these possibilities as inspiration for your own call flow expertise
  and creativity; this page is not exhaustive for all the potential use cases.

<div class="notification-important">
  <p><strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p>Be sure to test your call flows extensively to ensure they function appropriately

</div>
<h2 id="">Menus</h2>
<p>
  You have multiple options for creating a menu. The two most common options are
  to use either a <span class="interface">Queues</span> or
  <span class="interface">Options</span> block:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Queues</strong><br>
    This block is specifically designed to create a menu for contacts to select
    queues (or to reach certain departments). This is mainly because of its
    <span class="fieldName">Dynamically show available queues</span> setting.
    When enabled, if no agents are online to handle a specific queue, then it
    will not be presented to the contact as an option. Also, because contacts
    select a specific queue with this block, you do not need to add a
    <span class="interface">Select Queue</span> block after each option.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Options</strong><br>
    This essentially lets you create a custom menu. It allows you to use the
    text-to-speech (TTS) to present any prompt, then a contact can use their
    keypad to make a selection. Example menus using this block are:
    <ul>
      <li>Contacts choosing between English and Spanish.</li>
      <li>
        While a contact is waiting in a queue, present them options like
        continue waiting, requesting a callback, switching to text messaging,
        and so forth.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can also use the Options Group block. This block requires advanced configurations
  that involve API calls, parsing JSON, and so forth, and is less commonly used.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="QueueWithOptions"></a>
</p>
<h2 id="">Queue with Options</h2>
<p>
  You can present options to a contact while waiting in a queue. The purpose is
  to mitigate the time spent waiting. Even if a queue has a long wait time, the
  contact can possibly solve their issue in other ways. Also, giving the contact
  options allows them to choose their desired experience, increasing their satisfaction.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  This section explains how to make a queue with the following options:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continue waiting</li>
  <li>Leave a voicemail</li>
  <li>Request a callback</li>
  <li>Switch to the texting channel</li>
  <li>Connect with a specialist (an external transfer)</li>

      system.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- closes expandable -->
<p>
  <strong>Pre-requisite: You must have an offline queue created for voicemails</strong>
</p>
<p>To create a queue with options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Open an existing call flow in your Call Flow Designer. You can optionally
    create a new flow. If you create a new flow, you must configure the flow
    as desired and eventually add a menu to select a queue.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the menu, add a <span class="interface">Transfer to queue</span> block
    and connect it with the first queue option in the menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    Configure the <span class="interface">Transfer to queue</span> properties:
    <ol>
      <li>Click on the nodes in the block to open the properties.</li>
      <li>
        For <span class="fieldName">Wait Template</span>, add a text-to-speech
        prompt. This prompt plays before the wait music begins playing. For
        example, you could add
        <span class="fieldValue">Thank you for waiting, {{.firstName}}. Your queue position is {{.queuePosition}}</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        (Optional) If you do not want to use the system-default wait music,
        which is 25 seconds long, upload your own music file. The system-default
        music loops for four minutes before offering your options menu. Then,
        each subsequent loop, it plays for 1.5 minutes before offering your
        options menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scroll down in the properties panel and enable
        <span class="fieldName">Enhanced Queue Options</span>.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Add an <span class="interface">Options</span> block and connect it with the
    <span class="interface">Transfer to queue</span> block.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the following five options:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="fieldValue">Press one to continue waiting.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="fieldValue">Press two to leave a voicemail.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="fieldValue">Press three to request a callback.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="fieldValue">Press four to send a text message.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="fieldValue">If you would like to speak with a specialist instead, press five.</span>
        <em>(Optional)</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    (Optional) Customize these five options to your liking. You can change the
    prompt, choose a specific voice or effects, and so forth.
  </li>
  <li>
    Connect the five options with subsequent blocks:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add a <span class="interface">Continue waiting</span> block and connect
        it with option one. This block repeats the queue waiting flow without
        losing the contact's spot in the queue. It repeats the wait template
        → wait music → queue options flow. Alternatively, you can set a custom
        repeat time with a <span class="interface">Media</span> block. See
        the <a href="CustomWaitMusic">Custom Wait Music</a> section below
        for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a <span class="interface">Voicemail</span> block and connect
        it with option two. In this block's properties, select which offline
        queue you want to leave voicemails through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a <span class="interface">Request Callback</span> block and connect
        it with option three. Connect this with another
        <span class="interface">Options</span> block. Add two options:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="fieldValue">An agent is waiting for you. Press one to connect</span>.
            Then, connect this with a
            <span class="interface">Continue waiting</span> block.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="fieldValue">Press two to end the call</span>.
            Then, connect this with an <span class="interface">End</span>
            block.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Refer to the image above for assistance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a <span class="interface">Send SMS</span> block and connect it
        with option four. In the <span class="interface">Send SMS</span>
        block, enter the text message that you want to send to the contact.
        If they respond, the text will be routed and handled as a completely
        new text request.
      </li>
      <li>
        (Optional) Add an <span class="interface">External transfer</span>
        block and connect it with option five. In this block, enter the phone
        number of SIP ID for a number outside of your system for someone
        who can handle the call.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Be sure to configure the <span class="fieldName">No Reply</span> and
    <span class="fieldName">No Match</span> nodes in the
    <span class="interface">Options</span> blocks.
  </li>
  <li>Test the call flow.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  <a name="CallbackWithOptions"></a>
</p>
<h2 id="">Callback with Options</h2>
<p>
  A callback is when a contact is waiting in a queue, and instead of waiting for
  a long time, the system automatically calls them back when their "spot" reaches
  the front of the queue. Callbacks are a great way to ease your contact's stress
  of waiting for an agent.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How it works</strong>:<br>
  After requesting a callback, the contact can hang up the phone. The system saves
  their spot in the queue. When their spot reaches the front of the queue, the
  system offers a call request to an agent who can handle the queue. When the agent
  answers, the system then makes an outbound call to the contact. When they answer,
  they're presented with the option to end the call or speak with an agent.

      The following screenshot shows a queue options flow. The branch highlighted
      in blue is the callback functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Callbacks are generally created in conjunction with queue options, explained
      in the previous section. While the contact is waiting in a queue, they
      listen to wait music. After the wait music finishes one loop, a series
      of options plays. One of which is a callback option.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>To start a callback:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open an existing call flow in your Call Flow Designer.</li>
  <li>
    Add the <span class="interface">Request Callback</span> block to your flow.
    This is typically preceded by an <span class="interface">Options</span> block,
    where one option is to request a callback. This is illustrated in the previous
    example segment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the nodes to open the properties panel, then enable the
    <span class="fieldName">Enhanced Callback Options</span> setting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Connect the callback block to an <span class="interface">Options</span> block.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add two options: one for connecting with an agent and the other to end the
    call. Remember, the <span class="interface">Options</span> block uses text-to-speech,
    so consider the prompts that you want spoken to the contact.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add an <span class="interface">End</span> block and connect it with the option
    to end the call.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a <span class="interface">Continue waiting</span> block and connect it
    with the option to speak with an agent.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Configure the <span class="fieldName">No Reply</span> and
    <span class="fieldName">No Match</span> nodes of the
    <span class="interface">Options</span> block however you see fit. For example,
    you could connect them with a <span class="interface">Speak</span> block
    that says <span class="fieldValue">Sorry, I didn't catch that</span>, then
    returns to the options menu.

  Consider the standard experience of waiting in a call queue:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Contact selects which department they want to talk to</li>
  <li>Contact is placed in that department's queue</li>
  <li>
    A text-to-speech prompt is played, and the contact starts waiting for an
    agent to accept their call request
  </li>
  <li>While waiting, music plays</li>
  <li>Loop through steps 3 and 4 until an agent accepts the call</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The system-default wait music plays on a 25-second loop. However, you can customize:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The music that plays by using your own music file</li>
  <li>
    The repeated wait music time in an advanced queue with options
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These two customization options are explained in the following sections.
</p>
<h3 id="">Use a Custom Music File</h3>
<p>
  In the <span class="interface">Transfer to queue</span> block, the
  <span class="fieldName">Wait Music</span> property lets you use your own music.
  You can upload an MP3 or WAV file, or you can host a file on a cloud server and
  link to it. If you don't use your own file, the system-default music will play,
  which repeats every 25 seconds.

</p>
<h3 id="">Custom Repeat Time for Wait Music</h3>
<p>
  This is applicable when you have an advanced queue with options, explained
  <a href="#">in the section above</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  You use a <span class="interface">Media</span> block to control the amount of
  time that wait music plays after the first music loop. The first music loop plays
  with the <span class="interface">Transfer to queue</span> block. Then, one of
  the queue options is to continue waiting. This option should connect to a
  <span class="interface">Media</span> block. In this block, you upload a music
  file with the duration that you want the subsequent music loops to be. The screenshot
  below illustrates an example.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/guide-media/01JXK7DXE5AAJ6RKF8MR1BAM57" alt="Redacted image for privacy" width="499" height="292">
</p>
<p>
  In this instance, you could upload a 4-minute music file in the initial
  <span class="interface">Transfer to queue</span> block. Then, in the
  <span class="interface">Media</span> block, you could upload a separate file
  that's only 1.5 minutes long. This way, the queue options are repeated every
  1.5 minutes, if the contact chooses to continue waiting. Additionally, if the
  contact makes a menu selection while listening to the custom wait music, the
  call flow recognizes their selection even though the music is playing.&nbsp;
</p>
<h2 id="">Call Overflow</h2>
<p>
  During busy times of the day, you may want to offload calls to a third party
  or contact center outside of your Eltropy system. This may help you reduce certain
  SLAs like a high average hold time (AHT) and may improve your staffing options
  since agents may become overwhelmed.
</p>
<p>
  You can accomplish this in the call flow designer. You can use a combination
  of <span class="interface">Check queue depth</span> and
  <span class="interface">External transfer</span> blocks to handle the overflow.
  For example, you can add a threshold for your queue size. If the queue reaches
  and surpasses a certain number of callers, the system can start directing the
  new incoming callers to an external number.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Alternate options</strong>:
</p>
<p>For high call volume, you can also:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use the <span class="interface">Request callback</span> block. This lets
    the contact hang up the phone so they don’t have to sit and wait. The system
    holds their spot in the queue and calls the contact when it’s their turn.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the <span class="interface">Voicemail</span> block to transfer calls
    to an offline queue. This lets the contact leave a message for your agents.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="">Automate an NPS Survey after a Voice Call</h2>
<p>
  At the conclusion of a call, you can automatically send a text message with a
  link to a survey. This can be done using the
  <span class="interface">Send SMS</span> block. Add the message you want to send
  for the survey and include the survey link.
</p>

  Contact your Eltropy representative to learn how to handle internal queues for
  non-Eltropy agents.
