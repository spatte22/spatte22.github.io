			GSAP is a JavaScript library for creating web animations. It is beginner-friendly, but also robust enough for professional web developers. I created this introduction to GSAP for novice web developers. It covers the basics of creating an animation and mentions a few of the deeper concepts, like callback functions. GSAP already offers high-quality documentation, but it can be intimidating for a novice or beginner web developer. Because GSAP can easily be used by novices, this guide cuts straight to the point to create simple animations. Simple animations are an easy way to add personality, character, and flair to a website.<br />One key aspect of this guide is that it uses simple GSAP animations on the webpage, itself. It also describes the scripting behind the animations.
