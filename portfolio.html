			Quick Start for GSAP JavaScript Animations
			</div>
			<div class="portfolio-item-description">
			<p>GSAP is a JavaScript library for creating web animations. It is beginner-friendly, but also robust enough for professional web developers. I created this introduction to GSAP for novice web developers. It covers the basics of creating an animation and mentions a few deeper concepts like callback functions. GSAP already offers high-quality documentation, but it can be intimidating for a novice or beginner. Because GSAP can easily be used by novices, this guide cuts straight to the point to create simple animations. This is an easy way for beginners to add personality, character, and flair to a website.</p>
			<p>One key detail is that I used GSAP in the guide. I used these simple animations as examples.</p>

			Guide for Developers Integrating with NiCE CXone
			</div>
			<div class="portfolio-item-description">
			<p>CXone is industry-leading contact center software (CCaaS). They have a thriving community of integrators, including both customers and partners. Integrators had minimal self-service resources and constantly asked Support about registering their app with NiCE and setting up the correct form of API authentication. </p>
			<p>To solve this, I worked with a pair of lead engineers to create this getting started guide. Our approach included the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The guide needed to be instructional and task-oriented. This would help lead devs through the steps instead of obligating them to figure it out with minimal documentation.</li>
				<li>The guide would work in tandem with an Authentication and Authorization Overview, which we created to be a more in-depth discussion of how API authentication worked with CXone. </li>
				<li>The guide would prioritize a planning stage, which would also answer the FAQs that support engineers would handle.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The lead engineers informed me that this guide reduced their API-related support requests by 90%.</p>

			<div class="portfolio-item-description">
			<p>Voice Plus provides the ability to make VoIP phone calls in a contact center environment. This is a unique documentation example because the product offers a sandbox-style editor. Every customer would create their own custom call flows, which required a fair amount of referential material. Our style was to create task-oriented content, so I needed a healthy balance of task and reference articles.</p>
			<p>This example includes adaptations of several documentation pages, showing the combination of referential and task content.</p>

			<p>An introduction to the NiCE CXone partner billing APIs. I worked with a lead engineer for DEVone partner support to produce this quick start guide. The CXone billing APIs were undocumented, so this guide documents the APIs, including an overview of the required authentication.</p>
			<p>The final deliverable for this guide was a PDF. The support engineer required a quick deliverable to solve an emergency. Ideally, this set of APIs would be documented with the SwaggerUI, just like the other public CXone APIs. </p>

				<p>The Voobly APIs have minimal public-facing documentation that is incomplete. This page displays the APIs with the Swagger UI and provides enhanced documentation. I made minor customizations to the Swagger styling to match the theme of the portfolio. Without working directly with the Voobly developers, I was also able to expand the information around how the APIs work and what information you can access.</p>

Instead, we emphasized a planning phase that encouraged devs to plan their own unique updates. The audience was a mix of highly-technical and mildly-technical personnel.</p>
